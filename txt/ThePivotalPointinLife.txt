In the long journey of life, opportunity is like a bright star, occasionally streaking across the sky of fate, instantly illuminating the way forward and becoming a crucial factor that can change the trajectory of life. It always appears in a mysterious and elusive manner, bringing unexpected twists and possibilities to people.​
Throughout history, numerous examples have testified to the significant impact of opportunity on life. During the late Qin Dynasty, when the people were suffering from harsh living conditions, Chen Sheng was just a hired farmhand. However, when faced with the desperate situation of missing the due date due to rain in Daze Township and being sentenced to death according to the law, he keenly grasped this opportunity to change his fate. He shouted, "Are the kings, lords, and generals born with noble blood?" With a call, he raised the flag in revolt, igniting the flames of the first peasant uprising in Chinese history. Chen Sheng became the leader of this uprising. This opportunity not only changed Chen Sheng's personal fate but also had a profound impact on the development of Chinese history.​
In modern society with rapid technological development, opportunities are everywhere. The rise of the Internet industry has created unprecedented opportunities for countless people. Jack Ma, after coming into contact with the concept of the Internet, with his keen business acumen, discovered the huge business opportunities hidden therein. Although the domestic Internet environment was not yet mature at that time and faced many doubts and difficulties, he firmly seized this golden opportunity for the development of the Internet in China and founded Alibaba. From the initial difficult start - up to now, Alibaba has become a globally renowned e - commerce giant, and Jack Ma has also become a business legend. All of this stems from his accurate grasp and decisive actions regarding opportunities.​
Although opportunities seem accidental, in fact, they favor those who are prepared. Tu Youyou dedicated herself to the research of traditional Chinese medicine for decades. In the process of researching drugs for malaria treatment, she extensively consulted ancient books, deeply delved into traditional Chinese medicine knowledge, and did a lot of solid preparatory work. Finally, in the research of artemisinin extract, she grasped the key research direction and successfully discovered artemisinin, making an indelible contribution to global malaria prevention and control. Without years of knowledge accumulation and research precipitation, even if the opportunity was in front of her, it would be difficult for her to turn it into a world - changing achievement.​
However, opportunities do not come for no reason. We need to actively seek and discover them. This requires us to maintain a positive attitude, always pay attention to the changes around us, and broaden our horizons. For example, in the workplace, actively participate in various projects and be brave to try new fields. In this process, we may discover the hidden opportunities. At the same time, we also need to be brave to take risks. When an opportunity arises, we cannot be hesitant or timid. Many times, the gap between success and failure lies in whether we have the courage to act decisively when the opportunity comes.​
Opportunity is the turning point in life and the catalyst for success. It requires both careful preparation and the courage to seize. In the journey of life, let us use our sharp eyes, positive attitude, and decisive actions to capture those fleeting opportunities, write our own wonderful chapters, and let our lives shine with the most dazzling light under the illumination of opportunities.
